// The login.js file is a React component for handling user login. It includes form handling with state management for username, password, and error messages. The component utilizes custom hooks like usePersist for 
// remembering user credentials and useTitle for setting the page title. It makes use of the Redux Toolkit's useDispatch for state management and useLoginMutation from authApiSlice for the login process. On successful 
// login, it navigates to the dashboard page. Additionally, it includes UI elements like input fields for credentials and a checkbox for device trust, along with error handling and a loading spinner for better user 
// experience.
