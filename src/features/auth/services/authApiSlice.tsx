// The authApiSlice.js file is a crucial part of your application's authentication system. It extends the base API slice, apiSlice, by injecting endpoints specific to authentication processes, such as login, logout, 
// and token refresh. The login endpoint handles user sign-in, sendLogout manages the logout process and resets the API state upon successful logout, and refresh is for refreshing authentication tokens. 
// These endpoints integrate closely with the authSlice for state management, ensuring a seamless and secure user authentication experience in your application.
