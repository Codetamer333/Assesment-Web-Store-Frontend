// The Prefetch.js file in your application is a React component designed to preload data using Redux Toolkit Query's prefetching capabilities. It dispatches prefetch actions for notesApiSlice and usersApiSlice to load 
// notes and users data in advance. This proactive data fetching strategy is implemented in the component's useEffect hook, which ensures data is fetched and cached when the component mounts. By prefetching data, the 
// component enhances the user experience by reducing wait times for data loading. After the prefetching process, it renders its child components using Outlet.
