// The apiSlice.js file defines the API interactions for a web application using Redux Toolkit Query. It configures a base API query with a specific URL, sets up headers to include authentication tokens, 
// and handles token refresh on receiving a 403 error. This approach ensures secure and efficient API communication, with automatic handling of authentication token lifecycle. The file also sets the groundwork for 
// defining various API endpoints, making it a central part of your application's data fetching and state management strategy.
