// The store.js file  is responsible for configuring the Redux store, which is the central state management system for your React app. It imports and uses configureStore from Redux Toolkit to set up the
//  store with reducers, middleware, and other configurations. The store integrates apiSlice for API interaction and authReducer for authentication state management. Additionally, it uses middleware from apiSlice to 
//  enhance the store's functionality. The file also sets up Redux listeners to enable automatic re-fetching of data in response to certain actions, enhancing the app's reactivity and data consistency.
